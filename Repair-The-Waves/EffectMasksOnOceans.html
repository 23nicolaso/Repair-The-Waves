                    These facemasks are mostly created through polypropylene, a type of fabric polymer.
                    In a face mask, there are three layers: the inner, middle, and outer layers. These
                    three layers act as protection for filtering the airborne particles while having micro
                    nozzles to help with breathing.

                    Due to masks being created by various plastics, this has increased ocean pollution worldwide. According to
                    a study, a mask will take 450 years to break down as it progresses to become microplastics. These microplastics
                    contain various toxic chemicals that are dangerous for aquatic wildlife, contaminating the organisms in the
                    ocean. From this, the problem of ocean pollution has increased due to the rising use of masks from the pandemic.
                    This creates a constant cycle of usage of masks, making the problem more prevalent than ever before.

                    Additionally, the masks create an issue for marine life due to them commonly being wrongly disposed of.
                    According to the International Water Association, the discarded masks are often consumed by animals onshore,
                    causing respiratory issues and possible death.  The string from the facemask may also cause entanglement and strangulation
                    towards animals that attempt to consume it. This largely contributes to the issue of plastic pollution as many of these
                    masks are being discarded improperly. From this, it causes unavoidable death for the animals within this area.

                <div class="article_text">
                    Encourage the use of reusable masks. If using single-use masks, make sure to dispose of
                    them properly out. This includes removing the string to prevent entanglements! Recycle your waste properly.
