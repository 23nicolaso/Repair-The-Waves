                <div class="line"></div>
                <div class="definition">Plastic has become one of the fundamental materials of our lives, it’s cheap, durable, and easily accessible, however, these “qualities” of plastic have led us to lead a single-use lifestyle. Around the globe, plastic is being generated in large quantities, used once, and then thrown away. We hear the word “non-degradable” being used a lot with the topic of plastic, but choose to ignore it for the sake of our comfort. What many of us fail to realize is that plastic causes many problems to the environment, especially the marine ecosystems. According to scientists, our oceans will have more plastic than fish by the year 2050. This is an extremely severe problem that will change our lives forever, but there is still hope. 
                </div>
                <div class="definition">We at Repair The Waves believe that plastic has potential and that the key to a better future is upcycling. This is also known as a process of creative reuse, where waste materials and unwanted products are transformed into new and useful products! Plastic bags that can suffocate fish, straws that can choke turtles, old fishing equipment that can strangle seals, and all other plastic with its negative effects can be turned around. We can help create a circular economy and help save our oceans! 
                    Our aim is to sell upcycled plastic products and use our revenue to help educate the world about this problem in order to create change! Now the question is do you want to help?</div>
