            This article discusses recent developments in the plastic recycling field, and their potential
            implications. Specifically, this article focuses on recycling plastics by turning them into vanilla.

            Did you know? The smell of vanilla is known to directly impact the brain and induce calmness. It’s one
            one of the most common household ingredients and is also used in perfume manufacture, and hygiene and
            beauty products because of its many effects on the hair and skin. According to the Independent, the
            market for the chemical is said to reach $724 million by 2025. Recently, scientists at the University of
            Edinburgh have discovered a way to turn plastic waste into the infamous chemical flavor compound,
            vanillin! Vanillin is the main chemical compound of the extract of the vanilla bean. Today it is mainly
            used as a flavouring agent in many things, for perfumes and fragrances in both cleaning products and
            candles, in medicines to mask nasty odours or tastes or in sweet foods such as ice cream and chocolate.

            <h2 class="definition">Combatting Plastic Pollution</h2>
            <div class="article_text"> According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, about 8.3 billion tonnes of
                plastic has been produced since the 1950s, and only 9% of it has been recycled. Out of all, the biggest
                contributor to this pollution problem is single use plastic. Single use plastic is produced and designed to
                be thrown away after being used only once. For example, water bottles, bags or takeaway boxes. A full
                32% of the 78 million tons of plastic packaging produced annually is left to flow into our oceans; the
                equivalent of pouring one garbage truck of plastic into the ocean every minute. What do these plastic
                products have in common? Polyethylene terephthalate(PET). PET is a thermoplastic polymer and is
                heavily used in manufacturing containers for food or liquid like water bottles or skincare product
                containers.</div>
            <div class="gap"></div>
            <div class="article_text"> The scientists at Edinburgh utilized past research where they figured out how to use enzymes to break
                PET down into terephthalic acid (TA). They then took the TA and used an engineered version of the
                common bacteria E. coli bacteria to transform TA into vanillin. In a statement given by Dr. Ellis Crawford
                of the Royal Society of Chemistry, he says, ‘‘Using microbes to turn waste plastics, which are harmful to
                the environment, into an important commodity and platform molecule with broad applications in
                cosmetics and food is a beautiful demonstration of green chemistry.’’ Given that vanilla is such a highly
                desirable chemical, this new discovery is an incredible advancement and part of big developments that
                could aid in achieving a circular economy. Although vanillin traditionally comes from the extract of
                vanilla beans, today around 99% of the substance is produced synthetically with petrochemicals, similar
                to the way these scientists at Edinburgh have processed their vanillin. The researchers stated that the
                plastic-derived vanilla should be safe to eat, but more tests are needed before it ends up in stores.
